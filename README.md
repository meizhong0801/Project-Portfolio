# Analysis on customer coupon acceptance
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the acceptance rates across different conditions, we can hypothesize the following:
1. Drivers who frequent bars more often are more likely to accept bar coupons.
2. The presence of a specific passenger type (other than kids) and certain marital statuses affect acceptance.
3. Younger drivers (under the age of 30) show a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons. 
4. Drivers with lower incomes (less than $50,000) and a habit of dining at less expensive restaurants are more likely to accept related coupons.
